Build a Query Rewriter agent that refines user inputs for optimal retrieval and generation.
Introduce techniques like synonym expansion, query disambiguation, and noise reduction.
Implement a lightweight reinforcement learning loop to iteratively improve rephrasing quality based on retrieval success.
Provide fallback to original queries if rewrites degrade retrieval relevance.
